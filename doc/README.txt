Welcome to MinSoC. In order to put the system up and running you still have to follow two steps. 

1. Follow the INSTALL.pdf document found in this same directory. It will guide you to install the OpenCores modules which are part of the MinSoC system but not delivered with it. Furthermore, it will guide you to install the tools required to compile OpenRISC firmware and to connect to the system (upload and debug firmware). 

2. Follow the HOWTO.pdf document found in this same directory. This document guides you to compile MinSoC firmwares, to simulate the system running its firmware, and to synthesize the system to create a FPGA bitfile to configure your FPGA. Finally, it also guides you in running your first firmware on your FPGA. 

IMPORTANT: By any arisen problems, doubts or special requirements, take a look into the FAQ.pdf document. It includes possible adaptations you can easily make to the system, most reported problems using MinSoC and the Advanced Debug System, and even some tweak possibilities. If you have a problem which is not described there or you cannot make it work, please start a thread about your problem on OpenRISC forum: http://opencores.org/forum,OpenRISC

FINALLY: My system is up and running, what do I do next? The real system documentation is the minsoc.pdf document. It gives a thorough insight into MinSoC, its goals, design and ideas. It helps you to better understand the system and can give you a good idea of what to do next, after your system is up and running.
